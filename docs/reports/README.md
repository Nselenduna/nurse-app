- [Compliance Report](compliance-report.md) - Evaluation of GDPR and NMC regulatory compliance

- [Dependency Audit](dependency-audit.md) - Analysis of third-party dependencies, versions, and security vulnerabilities

## Using These Reports

These reports should be used to:

1. Understand the current state of the codebase

2. Prioritize technical debt and improvements

3. Guide refactoring efforts

4. Ensure security and compliance requirements are met

Each report follows a consistent structure:

- **Summary**: Brief overview of findings

- **Analysis**: Detailed examination of the relevant code/systems

- **Recommendations**: Concrete steps to address issues

- **Priority**: Categorization of issues by severity/impact

## Maintaining Reports

As the codebase evolves, these reports should be updated to reflect current state. When implementing changes based on these reports, mark the completed items and update the reports accordingly.
