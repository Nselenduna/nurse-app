## Missing Dependencies

The following dependencies are listed in package.json but are not installed:

1. **@react-native-community/netinfo** - Required for network connectivity monitoring

2. **expo-document-picker** - Required for file uploads and imports

3. **expo-sharing** - Required for sharing files and exports

## Upgrade Recommendations

### High Priority

1. Install missing dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-community/netinfo expo-document-picker expo-sharing

   ```


2. Update dependencies with major version changes:

   ```bash
   npm install react-native-reanimated@latest eslint-import-resolver-typescript@latest

   ```


### Medium Priority

1. Update React and React DOM:

   ```bash
   npm install react@latest react-dom@latest

   ```


2. Update React Native ecosystem packages:

   ```bash
   npm install react-native@latest react-native-gesture-handler@latest react-native-safe-area-context@latest react-native-screens@latest react-native-web@latest react-native-webview@latest

   ```


3. Update TypeScript and related packages:

   ```bash
   npm install typescript@latest @types/react@latest

   ```


### Low Priority

1. Update development dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @babel/core@latest @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest @typescript-eslint/parser@latest

   ```


2. Update minor React Navigation updates:

   ```bash
   npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs@latest

   ```


## Upgrade Strategy

Given the nature of React Native and Expo projects, it's recommended to follow these steps for a safe upgrade:

1. Create a git branch for the upgrade

2. Install missing dependencies first

3. Update high-priority dependencies

4. Run tests to ensure functionality

5. Update medium-priority dependencies

6. Run tests again

7. Update low-priority dependencies

8. Run a full test suite

9. Address any breaking changes or deprecation warnings

## Dependency Lockfile Analysis

The project uses `package-lock.json` for dependency locking. It's important to ensure this file is committed to version control and that all team members use the same versions of dependencies.

## Recommendations for Dependency Management

1. **Regular Audits**: Schedule monthly dependency audits

2. **Automated Checks**: Implement automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

3. **Version Pinning**: Use exact versions for critical dependencies

4. **Peer Dependencies**: Ensure peer dependencies are properly managed

5. **Dependency Pruning**: Remove unused dependencies

## Potential Issues

1. **React Native Reanimated**: Major version update (3.x to 4.x) may include breaking changes

2. **ESLint Resolver**: Major version update may require configuration changes

3. **Missing Dependencies**: The app may not function correctly until missing dependencies are installed

## Conclusion

The project's dependencies are generally in good shape with no known vulnerabilities. However, there are several outdated packages and missing dependencies that should be addressed. Following the recommended upgrade strategy will help maintain a secure and up-to-date dependency tree.
