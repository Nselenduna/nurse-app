# Security Scan Report

## Summary

- **Hardcoded Secrets**: None found

- **API Keys**: None found

- **Sensitive Information**: None found

- **Security Concerns**: Minor concerns related to error handling and data storage

## Scan Results

### Hardcoded Secrets

No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials were found in the codebase. This is a positive finding, indicating good security practices.

### Error Handling

Several instances of error logging were found that could potentially leak sensitive information in production:

1. In `src/services/StorageService.ts`:

   ```typescript
   console.error(`Error reading from storage: ${key}`, error);
   console.error(`Error writing to storage: ${key}`, error);
   console.error(`Error removing from storage: ${key}`, error);

   ```


2. In `src/services/CpdService.ts`:

   ```typescript
   console.error('Error loading CPD logs:', error);
   console.error('Error importing CPD data:', error);

   ```


These error logs should be replaced with structured logging that doesn't expose sensitive information in production environments.

### Data Storage

The application uses `AsyncStorage` for data persistence, which is appropriate for this type of application. However, there are a few considerations:

1. **Encryption**: The data stored in `AsyncStorage` is not encrypted by default. Consider encrypting sensitive data before storing it.

2. **Data Backup**: There's no clear mechanism for backing up user data. Consider implementing a backup strategy to prevent data loss.

3. **Data Validation**: Input validation is performed in some places, but it could be more comprehensive to prevent injection attacks.

### Authentication

The application has authentication routes (`(auth)`) but the implementation details were not found in the scanned files. Ensure that:

1. Credentials are not stored in plain text

2. Authentication tokens are stored securely

3. Proper session management is implemented

### Third-Party Dependencies

No direct integration with third-party services requiring API keys was found. However, if such integrations are added in the future, ensure that:

1. API keys are stored securely (e.g., environment variables, secure storage)

2. API keys have appropriate permissions and are rotated regularly

3. Network requests are made over HTTPS

## Recommendations

### 1. Improve Error Handling

Replace direct error logging with a structured logging service that:
- Sanitizes sensitive information

- Provides different log levels for development and production

- Allows for remote error reporting without exposing sensitive details

Example implementation:


```typescript
// Instead of:
console.error(`Error reading from storage: ${key}`, error);

// Use:
LoggingService.error('Failed to read from storage', error, 'StorageService');

```


### 2. Implement Data Encryption

For sensitive data stored in `AsyncStorage`:


```typescript
import * as Crypto from 'expo-crypto';

// Encrypt data before storing
async function encryptData(data: string, key: string): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation depends on the encryption library used
  // This is a simplified example
  const encrypted = await Crypto.digestStringAsync(
    Crypto.CryptoDigestAlgorithm.SHA256,
    data + key
  );
  return encrypted;
}

// Decrypt data after retrieving
async function decryptData(encryptedData: string, key: string): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation depends on the encryption library used
  // This is a simplified example
  return decryptedData;
}

```


### 3. Implement Secure Configuration Management

Create a secure configuration service that:
- Loads configuration from environment variables

- Provides sensible defaults for non-sensitive configuration

- Validates configuration values

Example implementation:


```typescript
// src/services/ConfigService.ts
class ConfigService {
  private static instance: ConfigService;
  private config: Record<string, any> = {};

  private constructor() {
    this.loadConfig();
  }

  static getInstance(): ConfigService {
    if (!ConfigService.instance) {
      ConfigService.instance = new ConfigService();
    }
    return ConfigService.instance;
  }

  private loadConfig(): void {
    // Load configuration from environment variables or secure storage
    this.config = {
      apiUrl: process.env.API_URL || 'https://api.example.com',
      // Other configuration values
    };
  }

  get<T>(key: string, defaultValue?: T): T {
    return this.config[key] ?? defaultValue;
  }
}

export default ConfigService.getInstance();

```


### 4. Implement Secure Storage for Sensitive Data

Use `expo-secure-store` for storing sensitive information:


```typescript
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

// Store sensitive data
async function storeSecureData(key: string, value: string): Promise<void> {
  await SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value);
}

// Retrieve sensitive data
async function getSecureData(key: string): Promise<string | null> {
  return await SecureStore.getItemAsync(key);
}

// Delete sensitive data
async function deleteSecureData(key: string): Promise<void> {
  await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(key);
}

```


### 5. Implement a Security Audit Process

Establish a regular security audit process that includes:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

- Code scanning for security issues

- Penetration testing

- Security review of new features

## Conclusion

The application appears to have good security practices in place, with no hardcoded secrets or API keys found. However, there are opportunities to improve error handling, data encryption, and configuration management to further enhance security.

By implementing the recommendations above, the application can achieve a higher level of security and better protect user data.
